#firebasic

Will turn input.json (intended to be exported from Firebase) into a series of folders with the appropriately named individual json blobs.

Generates a nested series of folders that can be served statically, API-compatibly with Firebase.

Think of it as Jekyll for your JSON.

##usage

`bundle install`
`ruby firebasic.rb`
